Welcome to my continuous job at Phrase! 

Continuous Localization
Continuous localization helps in projects and jobs that have incremental changes and require a continuous delivery of updated translated texts. It is the integration of the localization workflow into the development process instead of the tradition of it happening after the development process. As an example, in the software development environment, updated text strings are automatically handed off to the TMS and processed in time with the release cycle.
